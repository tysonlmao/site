            <h4>Theres been alot of shit bothering me, on my mind and both me just being me (that kid that talks way too much
        about tech) and being a little bit socially awkward but not as much as others (love u Addison) I think we can
        both agree Im way more fluent in trying to get a point across over a message rather then saying it in person.
        This is probably because I see it in my head as theres some sort of language gap between what Im thinking and
        how Im able to say it. Hopefully Im able to say everything in full in this because lately I have been ignoring
        how unfulfilled Ive been. Im pretty sure Ive told you that I am not straight and only started telling people
        this from October 2021 to now, and that I am not comfortable yet or may never be (more on this later) telling my
        parents or sister. I find it very hard living in a household with people that straight up piss on queer peoples
        graves. I havent seen as much homophobia anywhere other than in my own living room. Anything to do with anyone
        nearly queer, and its tearing strips saying that if either me or my sister were gay they would be disappointed,
        to the spectrum of if something about a non binary individual is brought up they say its bullshit and trans
        people are their birth sex and horrible stuff like that. Really doesnt give me confidence to tell them hey your
        son is bisexual and likes boys just as much as girls, also I think I like being more feminine sometimes in some
        ways. That would be me out of home and on the streets. And if they found out I wouldnt be able to neck myself
        before they neck me. Definitely dont think I have talked about this to you either because Ive been afraid of
        judgement and still definitely am, dont get me wrong. I definitely like being more feminine, and arguably act
        just a little bit more feminine than most others of my sex. Conforming to other people around me eventually is
        going to wear me down to a really bad state. Getting this out of the way, Ive tried thigh highs, and skirts
        before and really liked them. Still do behind closed doors (or closet as it were), and am worried Im never
        gonna have the confidence to open the door. But the thing that scares me the most about this being something
        that I like (alot to be frank), I dont ever think Im gonna find someone that would just accept that or like me
        for that and Im scared of being alone. In less than 5 months Ill be leaving for good this time, starting full
        time work at imageDirect and I really dont know how Im gonna go not seeing my friends. Im also done with the
        people at school about the acne on my face. The reason why Im 90% sure its there (because mind due my face was
        clear clear in January) is because I went through a stage in November 2021, through to February where I
        completely just stopped caring about everything due to the amount of stuff I was going through at the time.
        Having Zac almost leak to my family my sexuality and it making me anxious for weeks, my big health scare with
        the eating disorder I got diagnosed with and the amount of arguments and torture my parents put me through in
        that period instead of trying to support me and not being able to see anyone because I wasnt allowed out due to
        the health issues. It was during this time I started to get acne and its taken this long to start clearing in
        the last couple weeks. I hate it so much and it makes me feel like garbage. Now lets have an intermission back
        in the land of homophobia. Ever think that shaving your legs makes you (and I quote) a fucking faggot -my dad.
        Yeah me neither but when I started not caring anymore as much if my parents found out I was bi and that I would
        just have to take the blunt of it or Im gonna be completely depressed until I move out of home. So like Ive
        wanted to do for ages because I hate having body hair, and I cop that for it. Absolutely amazing. The funny
        thing is the next thing on my things I wanted to change for the better of my mental health, I really want to
        grow my hair out a bit more and keep it longer, and have it slightly shorter on the sides cuz I think it would
        look nice and thats what I want. I am not allowed while living under my parents roof to have my hair longer
        then they say, because when I was younger and admittedly a little bit more autistic as it were, if I could see
        my hair with my eyes without a mirror it used to annoy me and now thats all I want. Id probably dye it a
        little bit too but Im not sure what colour. Anyway, yeah thats really annoying. With all that said, shit that
        just bugs me in general are people that think they are better than you so they stop talking to you as much near
        their top shit friends (braden) and yes I called him out for it. People like Betty who spit acts of kindness in
        your face, having to conform because Im terrified of judgement by any means, my parents constantly breathing
        down my neck when it comes to my health, making that all we talk about and not being interested in anything else
        I have to say. Just little nick nacky things. I think another thing I need to work on is the sheer low amount of
        self esteem I have for myself, the level of social awkwardness Im at when Im struggling (not always socially
        awkward but you can be the judge of that), like I have been recently. People like Zac that give me hugs and
        stuff and ask if Im travelling okay, and I just dont know how to properly accept the gesture. Like still using
        Zac as an example, most of the time if Zac sees Im down or not travelling okay hell come over and give me a
        hug and most of the time Ill probably not hug him back properly, and it isnt because I dont want to. Like the
        language barrier I brought up earlier, I dont know how to just do it back. In my head when he started doing it
        if you were peeking inside my brain, youd see that I really appreciate it, and that I want to do it back but I
        just freeze and its so annoying. I think a couple months ago he gave me a hug because I was struggling with my
        health and after I went to the bathroom and started crying. But it isnt necessarily hard to spot if Im not
        fully there. Things that I dont see a way of controlling when Im either anxious, upset or angry at something
        or someone, probably because of my adhd, my legs shake uncontrollably, or youll see me move a conversation
        towards a subject Im interested in, like spacex, ltt, whats happening with Elon musk this minute. Those sorts
        of things. But yeah at the moment Im fully just shitting myself about whats gonna happen in the near future.
        In the next week Ill start tafe modules, be trying to stay at par with school, have less social life then I
        already do and work 30 hours a week. Then at the end of the year I stop being able to see my friends whenever I
        want during the week and will probably end up getting lonely. So yeah thatd probably be half of what I can
        think to write. But again Ive got short term memory loss so you cant blame me lmao</h4>
